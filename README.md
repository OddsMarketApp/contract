Revolutionary Dual-Contract
Prediction Market
Enterprise-grade decentralized binary prediction platform implementing LMSR algorithm with revolutionary dual-contract architecture for optimized performance and security.

Dual-Contract Architecture
Revolutionary architecture featuring two specialized smart contracts optimized for different market types and performance requirements.

LMSR Production Optimized
Risk-Reward Sharing Mechanism: In LMSR contracts, liquidity providers (LPs) are the providers of prize pools. They bear losses when outcomes don't maintain 1:1 ratio, but also gain excess profits above 1:1 ratio. Risk and reward coexist. Optimized for politics, social predictions, and entertainment markets with high subjectivity.

Zero Sum Optimized
Zero-Sum Game Mechanism with LP Fund Protection: Zero contracts implement true zero-sum games with complete LP fund isolation and protection, bearing no trading risks. Users trade in independent pools while LPs only provide liquidity support and earn fixed returns. Specialized for sports events, financial markets, and high-frequency trading scenarios.
